# WSN-Structure-Optimisation

This is the raw draft of a simplified code for the paper [Minimised Jaya Algorithm-based Structure optimisation for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9277064), presented and published in the proceedings of 2020 5th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Security (ICCCS).

Optimising the structure of a completely heterogenous wireless sensor network using the Genetic and the Jaya Algorithm.

* fitness function to be minimised = f(energy component, distance from the sink component)
* epochs: 30
* selection type: fittest chromosome tournament selection
* genome size = 20
* population size = 10

This is a basic and simplified version of the code to have a very basic understanding of the paper. The experimentation in the paper involves more optimisation algorithm besides the Genetic and the Jaya Algorithm.
